Today I learned that people in the open source world are so friendly, sometimes to a unbelievable extent. I have three examples:

* I reported [building error](https://github.com/tibbe/network-bytestring/issues/3) to a no-longer-supported Haskell library [network-bytestring](https://github.com/tibbe/network-bytestring). Got quick replies from people who seemed really care and they're really helpful despite the fact that in turn there are unlikely any issue with their software just my broken environment.
* I got interested in the [Nix](http://nixos.org/nix/) package manager and installed it on my laptop. Since I'm entirely new to it, I have LOTS of newbie questions, mostly "can I / how to do this in Nix" ones. I can read the whole manual for 30 minutes and find out the answers. But I [asked them](http://nixos.org/irc/logs/log.20101118) in [#nixos](irc://irc.freenode.net/#nixos) IRC channel and get my answers in about 30 seconds.
* I was really impressed by Nix and [thinking about](http://twitter.com/tianyi/status/5297670868439041) combining its power with [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew). But I have little clue how to do this, so I [asked](http://mail.cs.uu.nl/pipermail/nix-dev/2010-November/005506.html) in [nix-dev](https://mail.cs.uu.nl/mailman/listinfo/nix-dev) mailing list. Not only I got [quality reply](http://mail.cs.uu.nl/pipermail/nix-dev/2010-November/005507.html), [Marc Weber](https://github.com/MarcWeber) also offered me an SSH account in a [Nixos](http://nixos.org/nixos/) machine to save my time learning and playing with Nix. I got far more than what I expected!

Having a such great community, what else can I do except trying my best to be friendly, helpful, and most importantly, contributive!
