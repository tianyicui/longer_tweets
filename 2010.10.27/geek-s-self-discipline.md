The line `alias v='vim'` has been in my `.bashrc` for a long time but I've been always typing `vim` in terminal hundreds of times a day (which actually opens `mvim`).

So the solution is, in `.bashrc`: `alias v='mvim'` and `alias vim="echo use 'v' instead !!! # "`. I'll *force* myself to use a more convenient way.

Future plans include: disable `:w` and `:q` in order to force me to use `command-S` and `command-W` in MacVim; disable keys like `left-shift-A` and `left-shift-1` ...

This is just **geek's self-discipline**.
