"A language that doesn't affect the way you think about programming is not worth knowing." â€”Alan Perlis

So maybe we can say:

A book that doesn't affect the way you think about certain area is not worth reading.

An area of knowledge that doesn't affect the way you think about life, universe and everything is not worth learning.

A friend that doesn't affect the way you think about life and friendship is not worth making.

...

Same can apply to anything: a blog worth subscribing, a software worth using, a skill worth mastering, a place worth going, an experience worth trying, a person worth knowing, a life worth living ...

I hope reading all this DOES affect the way you think about thinking and making choices.
